# Eavesdrop.FM
> Submit your Plex music listening data to ListenBrainz

## What is it?
Born out of a desire to contribute my listening data to the ListenBrainz project, Eavesdrop.FM is a web service that takes Plex webhook payloads and submits them to ListenBrainz via the ListenBrainz API.

## How do I use it?
Head to [Eavesdrop.FM](https://eavesdrop.fm) and follow the step-by-step guide to get started.

## Important update
If you created your webhook URL on or before 2020-09-26 and shared your Plex logs to a third party, you may have unintentionally disclosed your ListenBrainz user token. Please go to Eavesdrop.FM to generate a new URL. [See here](https://github.com/simonxciv/eavesdrop.fm/issues/5) for further information.
